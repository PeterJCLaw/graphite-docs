# Share Graphite with your team

We explicitly designed Graphite so that you can use our CLI & web dashboard without the rest of your team having to change their workflows, but there are a lot of reasons why we think they'll want to adopt Graphite! By virtue of your early access to Graphite, anyone else from your organization can also join the beta without waiting in line - here's how to invite them:

Want to invite a friend from a different company?  As a Graphite beta user, you'll also get a limited number of external invites per month, which you can use to send to folks outside of your organization!
