# Customizing the review queue

## Editing a section

If you want to customize a section, click the ⚙️ icon in the upper right of the section to open the section editing modal:

From this modal, you can update the section name, repositories, and filters, choose whether to include PRs in the section on the favicon badge count, and delete the section.

## Creating a new section

If you want to add a new section, just click "add section" on the left side navigation bar to open the section creation modal:
