# Getting started with the dashboard

1. Sign in with GitHub at [https://app.graphite.dev/](https://app.graphite.dev)
2. Select one or more of the repos you most frequently work in
3. Graphite will create 6 default sections of pull requests in your repos:
   * **Needs your review** - any PRs where you (or your team) have been tagged as a reviewer
   * **Needs your attention** - your PRs which have been approved or changes have been requested
   * **Waiting for author** - someone elseâ€™s PRs which you (or another reviewer) have approved or requested changes on
   * **Waiting for reviewers** - your PRs which are waiting for review
   * **All other pull requests** - all other PRs in the repos you selected

Now that you have your dashboard set up, let's take a look at your review queue.
