# Feature requests & bugs

As a Graphite beta user, your feature requests & bug reports play a huge part in helping us improve the product experience. We made feedback a first-class feature in all of our product & community surfaces:

* From the CLI, just run `gt feedback {your message}` to share with us
* From the Graphite dashboard, click "Send feedback" in the lower left corner to send free-form feedback
* From the Graphite dashboard, click "Feature requests & bugs" in the lower left corner to share a feature request or bug to be voted on by the Graphite community

![Browse, upvote, and submit new feature requests to the Graphite team](../../.gitbook/assets/feature\_board\_short\_100.gif)

You can also always post your feedback or suggestions in the `#feature-requests` or `#bug-reports` channels in the Graphite Community Slack channel:
