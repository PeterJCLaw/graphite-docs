# Command shortcuts

{% hint style="info" %}
Graphite's CLI is intended to be used for every operation related to source control, so we wanted to make sure it feels fast and efficient to use. One of the easiest ways to save time with `gt` is to use the abbreviated commands!
{% endhint %}

Every command in `gt` has a short version to save you time as you're typing, and **we strongly recommend that you get familiar with the abbreviated versions** of the most frequently used commands:

```bash
## creating and updating a stack
gt bc # gt branch create
gt cc # gt commit create
gt ca # gt commit amend

## viewing a stack
gt l # gt log
gt ls # gt log short
gt ll # gt log long

## navigating a stack
gt bco # gt branch checkout
gt bu # gt branch up
gt bd # gt branch down
gt bt # gt branch top
gt bb # gt branch bottom

## creating a pull request
gt ss # gt stack submit

## syncing & resolving conflicts
gt rs # gt repo sync
```

Once you're familiar with these shortened commands, you'll be able to work with stacks faster than ever.  There are even more of these in the command reference!
