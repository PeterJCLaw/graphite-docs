# Installing the CLI

Install the Graphite CLI using either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [homebrew](https://www.brew.sh):

#### **npm installation**&#x20;

```bash
# Install Graphite from npm.
npm install -g @withgraphite/graphite-cli
gt --version
```

#### **brew installation (on MacOS)**

```bash
# Install Graphite from Homebrew.
brew install withgraphite/tap/graphite
gt --version
```

### **Windows**

If you'd like to use Graphite on Windows, we recommend working within Windows Subsystem for Linux.  Follow the [instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to set it up.  After setting up WSL, you can [set up nvm/node/npm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl) and then install Graphite as normal!

### **Initialization**

Graphite stores a small JSON configuration file in `.git/.graphite_repo_config` of your repositiory. On first execution, the CLI will prompt you to provide a minimal amount of info to populate this config.

```
# Initialize Graphite.
cd ~/my-project
gt repo init

# Authenticate Graphite CLI via the web dashboard (needed to create PRs).
# Visit https://app.graphite.dev/activate to obtain your auth token and then
# paste it below.
gt auth --token <auth_token>
```

Once you've set up the CLI, it's time to authenticate with your GitHub account via the Graphite dashboard.
