# Shell completion setup

Graphite supports `bash` and `zsh` tab completion. After installing Graphite for the first time, you can run (e.g. if using `zsh`, the default on Mac):

```
gt completion >> ~/.zshrc
```

For `bash`, you'd replace `.zshrc` with `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.\

_We don't currently support_ `fish` _completions, but we're looking to â€” if you're passionate about it, maybe you can help us out with an open source contribution!_
