Graphite's CLI **** gives you 3 different ways to visualize your current stack.
{% endhint %}

### `gt log` (most common)

### `gt log short` (compact view)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-05-04 at 11.19.35.png>)

### `gt log long` (detailed view)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-10-14 at 11.54.05 AM.png>)

Now that you can quickly visualize your stack, you can use Graphite to navigate it and update mid-stack branches before you submit your PRs.
