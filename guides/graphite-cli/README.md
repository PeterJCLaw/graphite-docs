# Graphite CLI

Graphite's command line tool helps you **break up large engineering tasks into a series of small, incremental code changes**, each of which can be tested, reviewed, and merged independently. This helps you **stay unblocked** as an author, and **get faster, more thoughtful comments** from your reviewers.
