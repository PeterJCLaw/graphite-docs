# Graphite CLI



{% hint style="info" %}
Graphite's command line tool helps you **break up large engineering tasks into a series of small, incremental code changes**, each of which can be tested, reviewed, and merged independently. This helps you **stay unblocked** as an author, and **get faster, more thoughtful comments** from your reviewers.
{% endhint %}

Get started with the Graphite CLI:

{% content-ref url="installing-the-cli/" %}
[installing-the-cli](installing-the-cli/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
