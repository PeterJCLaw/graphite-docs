# Updating mid-stack branches

Stacked changes aren't just about adding more branches on top - sometimes you want to go back and change something mid-stack. Graphite makes it easy to update a mid-stack branch, and conveniently restacks upstack branches automatically.

After updating branches in your stack locally, you can run `gt stack submit` again to push the changes to remote.

## Adding commits

Let's say you receive some comments in code review that you want to address with a new commit before landing a branch in the middle of your stack - here's how you'd do this with `gt`:

```bash
# address review comments with a new commit
gt branch checkout my_stack_level_1
gt commit create -a -m "my fourth commit" # -> automatically restacks both upstack branches
```

![Graphite will automatically perform the recursive rebases if you have up-stack changes when you run gt commit create on a mid-stack branch.](../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled.png)

## Amending commits

If you prefer to just amend a previous commit, this is just as easy with `gt`:

```bash
# address review comments by amending a commit
gt branch checkout my_stack_level_1
gt commit amend -a -m "my updated commit" # -> automatically restacks both upstack branches
```

## Resolving rebase conflicts

If `gt commit create` or `gt commit amend` encounter any conflicts as they recursively restack your branches, you'll be prompted to resolve your conflicts before continuing:

Note that Graphite does not currently provide its own abort command â€” `git rebase --abort` is safe to use to abort a single rebase in progress, but will not undo prior restack operations if your command already completed them.&#x20;
